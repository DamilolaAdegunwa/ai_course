Project Title: Generating Seasonal Landscapes with Specific Weather Conditions
File Name:
generating_seasonal_landscapes_with_weather_conditions.py

Description: This project will generate landscapes for different seasons with specific weather conditions. The user provides a prompt that describes the season and the weather (e.g., "a snowy winter forest with fog", "a rainy summer day by the sea"). The AI will generate images capturing these detailed scenes, focusing on seasonal elements like snow, rain, sunshine, or fog.
