Project Title: Multi-Image Grid Generator Using OpenAI Image Generation
In this project, we will use OpenAI's image generation capabilities to create multiple images from different prompts and combine them into a single grid image. The project will generate a series of images based on various prompts and then assemble them into a composite grid. This project advances your skills by incorporating image processing and manipulating multiple image outputs into a unified visual display.

Project Overview
In this advanced project, you will generate multiple images based on different prompts and organize them into a single grid-like composite image. You'll practice working with multiple outputs from the OpenAI image API and manipulating these images using Pythonâ€™s PIL library to form a visually appealing grid. This project will build your expertise in handling API requests, manipulating image outputs, and integrating them into a single cohesive design.
