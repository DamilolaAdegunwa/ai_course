Project Title: Text-to-Image Collage Generator
Description:
In this project, we will create a Text-to-Image Collage Generator. The generator takes multiple prompts from the user, generates individual images for each prompt using the OpenAI API, and arranges them into a grid collage (e.g., 2x2, 3x3, etc.). You will learn to generate multiple images, manipulate their arrangement, and create a visually cohesive collage in a single output image.

This project advances on the previous one by:

Handling multiple images in a structured layout (collage).
Controlling the size and arrangement of the images.
Dealing with multiple API calls efficiently and learning basic image manipulation like resizing and pasting images into a collage.

"""
Key Learning Points:
Image Grid Layout: You will learn to organize images into a structured grid layout (collage), which requires positioning and pasting images in a specific arrangement.
Multiple API Requests: The project will reinforce your understanding of making multiple OpenAI API calls, handling them efficiently, and organizing the outputs into a single image.
Resizing and Pasting Images: Basic image manipulation techniques like resizing images to fit them into a grid layout and pasting them onto a blank canvas will be covered.
Example Use Case:
Create a 2x2 collage of different artistic styles by entering prompts like:

"A futuristic cityscape"
"A serene mountain lake"
"Abstract geometric shapes"
"A surreal dreamscape"
The result will be a collage of four images, each reflecting one of the prompts, arranged in a grid.

Challenges for Further Development:
Custom Collage Sizes: Allow users to define custom sizes for each image in the collage rather than fixing all images to the same size.
Advanced Layouts: Explore more complex collage arrangements like diagonal or circular layouts, where the grid is less rigid.
Interactive Collage: Allow users to drag and drop images to rearrange them before generating the final collage, offering more creative control.
This project is noticeably more advanced than the previous one because you now manage multiple images at once and focus on arranging them into a cohesive structure. The additional complexity of generating several images, handling their placement, and working with a grid introduces new challenges while still being manageable.
