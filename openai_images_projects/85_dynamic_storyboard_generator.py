Project Title: AI-Powered Dynamic Storyboard Generator for Animated Films
File Name: dynamic_storyboard_generator.py
Description:
In this advanced project, we will create an AI-Powered Dynamic Storyboard Generator capable of generating a sequence of images based on a detailed storyline or screenplay. This tool is designed to assist animators, filmmakers, and creative professionals in visualizing key moments of an animated film or series. It uses OpenAIâ€™s image generation capabilities to create a series of scene-specific images that capture the essence of a provided screenplay.

The goal is to break down a movie or animation script into individual scenes, identify key descriptive elements, and use AI to visualize each scene with stunning detail. The project involves handling a storyline breakdown, scene-to-image transformation, and maintaining visual coherence across multiple images in a single narrative flow.

This project introduces several advanced techniques:

Scene Text Analysis and Keyframe Extraction: Identifies critical moments in a script or description to determine which parts should be visualized.
Scene Progression: Tracks character evolution, environment changes, and emotional tone, ensuring consistency across generated images.
Character Consistency: Maintains visual consistency of characters across multiple scenes by feeding previous image references back into subsequent prompt generations.
This will allow users to create dynamic and visually cohesive storyboards from text-based descriptions, helping to bring stories to life without the need for manual drawing or artist intervention.
