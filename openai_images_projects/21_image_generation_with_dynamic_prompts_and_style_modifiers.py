Project Title: Image Generation with Dynamic Prompts and Style Modifiers
Description:
This exercise introduces dynamic prompt modification and style variations for each image generated from a base prompt. You will generate multiple images, each with a slight tweak in the style or theme, such as "cyberpunk," "steampunk," "minimalistic," and so on. This teaches you how to modify prompts programmatically and handle batch API calls to create a visually diverse set of images while sticking to a consistent underlying concept.

Instead of manually adjusting the prompts, the script will add style modifiers to a base prompt and generate images accordingly. Youâ€™ll also learn to handle and display these variations.

Key Learning Points:
Prompt Variations with Style: You will learn how to modify a base prompt dynamically by applying different style modifiers, such as "cyberpunk" or "minimalistic," to generate unique but related images.
Grid Layout for Stylized Images: Handle multiple variations of the base image with style and create a grid layout to visualize them in a structured collage.
Efficient API Calls for Variations: Making batch API calls with dynamic prompts and processing the results into a visual output further develops your skills in API usage and handling images in Python.
Example Use Case:
Base Prompt: "A futuristic city skyline at sunset"

Styles:

"cyberpunk"
"steampunk"
"minimalistic"
"abstract"
The script will generate four images, each depicting the base concept of a futuristic city but styled according to the chosen modifiers. The result will be a collage of all four images, showing how a single concept can be interpreted differently by adding style-based variations.

Next Challenge:
Once you're comfortable with this exercise, you can push further by:

Adding More Styles: Incorporate more complex style prompts like "baroque," "post-apocalyptic," or even more abstract styles.
Dynamic Image Sizes: Experiment with varying image sizes in a single collage.
Random Style Generation: Let the script randomly choose styles or even mix styles for more creative outputs.
This project builds on your previous experience by introducing dynamic prompt modifications and style variations, helping you explore more creative ways to generate images using the OpenAI API while also improving your prompt-engineering skills.
