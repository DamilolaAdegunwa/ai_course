Project Title: Dynamic Landscape Generator Based on Seasons and Time of Day
File Name: dynamic_landscape_generator.py

Project Description: This project will dynamically generate landscape images based on two key parameters: the season and the time of day. By inputting the season (e.g., winter, summer) and time of day (e.g., morning, night), you will create themed landscape images such as a snowy night or a bright summer morning. The project builds on your previous work but introduces more complexity by incorporating different themes and blending multiple concepts into a single prompt.

The code will generate a descriptive image based on combinations of seasons and times of day, allowing you to explore how prompt variations impact the generated results.

Python Code:

Example Inputs and Expected Outputs:
Input:

Season: winter
Time of Day: night
Expected Output:

An image of a snow-covered landscape under the moonlight, with stars visible in the dark sky. The image should evoke a calm winter night.
Input:

Season: summer
Time of Day: morning
Expected Output:

A bright, sunny landscape featuring clear skies, lush green trees, and flowers in full bloom, representing a peaceful summer morning.
Input:

Season: spring
Time of Day: afternoon
Expected Output:

A vivid image of blooming flowers, lush green fields, and a sun-drenched landscape, symbolizing the liveliness of spring in the afternoon.
Input:

Season: autumn
Time of Day: evening
Expected Output:

A landscape with vibrant autumn leaves and soft, warm lighting from the setting sun, giving a peaceful evening glow.
Input:

Season: winter
Time of Day: dawn
Expected Output:

A crisp, cold dawn with snow-covered trees and a gentle sunrise illuminating the white landscape with hues of pink and orange.
This project allows you to explore how different settings influence the mood and details of a generated image. By focusing on combinations of seasons and times of day, youâ€™ll expand your ability to craft specific, nuanced prompts for generating thematic art.
