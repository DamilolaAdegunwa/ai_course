Project Title: Image Variations Grid from a Single Prompt
Description:
In this exercise, we will take a single prompt and generate multiple variations of images from that prompt. The goal is to build a grid layout (collage) that displays different variations of the image generated from the same prompt. This will help you learn how to work with variations, multiple API calls, and arranging images into a grid, while handling their retrieval and processing efficiently.

This project advances your previous one by introducing image variation generation and grid arrangement of similar but distinct images based on a single prompt. Instead of handling different prompts for each image, you will work with variations and structure them into a grid.

"""
Key Learning Points:
Image Variations: You will learn how to generate multiple image variations from a single prompt using OpenAI's image generation capabilities.
Collage Construction: Handling multiple variations and arranging them into a grid is a step up in complexity compared to simply generating a grid of unrelated images.
Efficient API Calls: This exercise emphasizes making multiple API calls, retrieving the images, and processing them effectively into a final composition.
Example Use Case:
Use a prompt like "A futuristic robot in a neon city", and the script will generate multiple variations of this concept and arrange them into a collage. Each image will have its own slight differences while staying within the theme.

This could be applied to explore variations of an artistic idea or create a collage that showcases different interpretations of the same concept.

Next Challenge:
After completing this project, you can try adding features such as:

Dynamic Grid Size: Let the user decide how many rows and columns they want in the grid.
Advanced Prompt Modifications: Instead of repeating the same prompt for each variation, introduce slight modifications to the prompt for more diverse results.
Image Filters: Apply post-processing filters (e.g., grayscale, sepia) to the generated images to give each variation a different effect.
This project is noticeably more advanced than the previous one as you handle variations of the same image, emphasizing creativity, repetition, and manipulation. This offers a deeper dive into image handling and manipulation but keeps the complexity manageable.
