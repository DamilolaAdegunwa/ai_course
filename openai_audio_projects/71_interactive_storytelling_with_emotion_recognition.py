"""
Here’s your next advanced OpenAI audio project, which builds on your previous experiences and adds more complexity. This project will involve creating an Interactive Storytelling Experience with Emotion Recognition and Voice Cloning, leveraging OpenAI’s capabilities.

Project Title: Interactive Storytelling with Emotion Recognition and Voice Cloning
File Name: interactive_storytelling_with_emotion_recognition.py

Project Description:
In this project, you will create an interactive storytelling application that uses emotion recognition from the user’s voice to dynamically adjust the narrative and characters' responses. The application will incorporate voice cloning technology to generate personalized character voices, enhancing immersion and engagement in the storytelling experience.

Key Features:
Voice cloning to create unique character voices.
Emotion detection from user input to influence the story dynamically.
Adaptive narrative generation based on user emotional responses.
Background music and sound effects to enhance the storytelling experience.
Example Inputs and Expected Outputs:
Input: User narrates a scene with excitement, e.g., "I just found the treasure hidden in the cave!"

Expected Output: The system recognizes the excitement, and the character responds with enthusiasm: "What a fantastic discovery! Let's celebrate!"
Input: User speaks in a somber tone, e.g., "I lost everything in the storm."

Expected Output: The character offers comfort: "I'm so sorry to hear that. Together, we can rebuild."
