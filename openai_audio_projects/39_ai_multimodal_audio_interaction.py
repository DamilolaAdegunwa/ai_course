Project Title: AI-Powered Multimodal Audio Interaction: Live Conversational Agent with 3D Spatial Audio and Emotion-Driven Music Composition
File Name: ai_multimodal_audio_interaction.py

Project Overview:
This project builds upon the previous real-time multilingual narration system but takes the complexity to a new level by introducing 3D spatial audio for immersive user interaction and emotion-driven music composition. This project creates a live conversational agent that interacts using multilingual voice, emotional feedback, and custom-generated background music. Additionally, the project integrates 3D spatial audio to simulate how sound is perceived from different directions and distances, offering a truly immersive experience.

This project combines advanced conversational AI, emotion detection, live audio manipulation, and real-time music generation, creating a multimodal interaction that not only involves language and emotion but also the auditory experience of spatial sound and music composed on the fly based on emotional context.

Key Features:
3D Spatial Audio for Real-Time Conversations: The system will simulate 3D audio effects based on the position of characters or sound sources, allowing users to feel as if voices and sounds are coming from different directions.
Emotion-Driven Music Composition: AI will generate custom background music based on the detected emotions in real-time, altering rhythm, tempo, and style dynamically.
Live Multilingual Conversational Agent: Similar to the previous project, but with enhanced natural language processing to handle more complex dialogue flow, emotional shifts, and seamless multilingual switching.
Environmental Soundscapes with Spatial Audio: Environmental sound effects will be spatially distributed to create an immersive listening experience (e.g., footsteps coming from behind, water sounds to the left).
Adaptive Voice Modulation Based on Surroundings: The voice synthesis will adjust based on both emotional tone and 3D positioning, simulating real-life interactions where voices sound different based on where they're coming from.
Advanced Emotional and Contextual Understanding: Beyond simple emotional detection, the agent will consider contextual cues from conversation to influence emotional feedback and background soundscapes.
Real-Time Music & Sound Mix: The system will dynamically adjust the volume and intensity of 3D sounds, music, and voices in response to emotional context and user interaction.
Advanced Concepts Introduced:
3D Spatial Audio Simulation: Simulating real-life 3D sound, creating the illusion that voices or sounds are coming from various directions or distances.
Emotion-Driven Music Generation: Using AI models to compose and alter music on the fly based on emotional content detected from the conversation.
Context-Driven Dynamic Sound Mix: Handling the interaction between voices, soundscapes, and music in real time by adjusting levels to ensure they complement one another.
Natural Language Understanding for Emotion: More complex conversational dynamics, where the AI interprets not only the words but the emotional weight of context and adjusts its responses, tone, and voice.
Seamless Multimodal Interaction: Merging language, spatial audio, and live music generation into a single interaction loop.
