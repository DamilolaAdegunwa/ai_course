Project Title: Audio Scene Understanding and Adaptive Sound Design
File Name: audio_scene_understanding_adaptive_sound_design.py

Project Description:
In this project, we'll develop a system that can:

Understand Audio Scenes: Analyze an audio file, classify different acoustic scenes (e.g., indoors, outdoors, traffic, conversation), and detect relevant environmental sounds (e.g., footsteps, rain, crowd noises).
Adaptive Sound Design: Based on the scene classification, the system will automatically generate ambient soundscapes (like background music or environmental sound effects) that match the audio context.
Dialogue Isolation and Enhancement: Isolate spoken dialogue from complex audio scenes and enhance the clarity of speech for a better listening experience in noisy environments.
This project integrates audio classification, environmental sound synthesis, and advanced audio manipulation, focusing on making dynamic adjustments based on contextual analysis. It’s ideal for AI-driven audio experiences in films, VR, and interactive games.

Example Inputs and Expected Outputs:
Example 1:

Input Audio: A 10-second clip recorded in a busy city street with sounds of traffic and people talking in the background.

Expected Output:

Scene Classification: "traffic"
Isolated Dialogue: Spoken dialogue from the people talking in the background, enhanced for clarity.
Adaptive Soundtrack: A background noise that simulates traffic sounds.
Example 2:

Input Audio: A 10-second clip recorded in a quiet park with occasional birds chirping.

Expected Output:

Scene Classification: "park"
Isolated Dialogue: If there’s any conversation, it’s isolated from background noise.
Adaptive Soundtrack: Generated sounds of birds chirping and soft wind blowing.
Key Features:
Scene Classification: The system analyzes the audio file to detect and classify the environment, enabling it to understand various acoustic contexts.
Dialogue Isolation and Enhancement: Uses audio filters to separate speech from environmental sounds and enhance it, making dialogue clearer in noisy audio clips.
Adaptive Sound Design: Automatically generates soundscapes or background sounds that match the scene, allowing for a highly immersive audio experience in VR, games, or films.
Real-Time Processing: Like the previous projects, this also emphasizes real-time audio manipulation to maintain interactivity.
Use Cases:
Audio Restoration: Use this system to isolate and enhance speech in noisy environments, making it ideal for applications in journalism, podcasts, or surveillance.
Immersive Experiences: In VR or gaming, dynamically classify the scene based on player audio and adjust soundscapes to reflect real-time events or contexts, such as transitioning from indoor to outdoor environments.
Content Creation: Automatically generate ambient soundscapes for films or media based on the classified environment, improving the efficiency of sound design in post-production.
Assistive Technology: Provide real-time speech enhancement for users in noisy environments, like those with hearing impairments.
This project increases the complexity by focusing on scene understanding and adaptive sound design. Unlike previous projects that emphasized speech generation and emotion, this one introduces real-world acoustic scene classification and dynamically changes background audio based on the context, providing a deeper level of interaction with the environment.
