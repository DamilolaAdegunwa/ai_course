Explanation:
Impulse Response (IR):

You can use any impulse response (IR) file to simulate reverb. These IR files are recordings of how sound behaves in real environments and are commonly used for convolution reverb.
Convolution:

np.convolve(sound, ir) applies the reverb effect by convolving the original sound with the IR file.
Saving the File:

The processed file is saved as reverb_applied_output.wav using soundfile.write.
Key Dependencies:
librosa: For loading audio and applying convolution.
pydub: For handling playback.
soundfile: For saving the processed audio file.
Youâ€™ll need an IR file (impulse response) to simulate the reverb effect. You can find many free IR files online that mimic various room sizes and environments.
