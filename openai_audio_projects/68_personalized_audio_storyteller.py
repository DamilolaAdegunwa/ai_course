Project Title: Personalized Audio Storyteller with Emotion Recognition
File Name: personalized_audio_storyteller.py

Project Description:
The Personalized Audio Storyteller with Emotion Recognition project utilizes OpenAI's audio capabilities and emotion recognition technology to create a unique storytelling experience. This system generates personalized stories based on user inputs and adjusts the emotional tone of the narration and background music in real time. By recognizing the user's emotions through voice analysis, the storyteller can enhance the narrative experience, making it engaging and immersive.

Key Features:
Dynamic Story Generation: Use AI to generate personalized stories based on user preferences and inputs.
Emotion Recognition: Analyze user emotions using speech recognition and adjust the storytelling approach accordingly.
Adaptive Audio Experience: Generate and play background music that matches the emotional tone of the story.
Real-Time Interaction: Allow users to influence the story direction by interacting verbally, which is evaluated by the system.
Memory Integration: Maintain a session memory of previous interactions to tailor the storytelling experience further.
Advanced Concepts:
Emotion Analysis: Use sentiment analysis on user input to adjust the story and audio elements dynamically.
Contextual Audio Effects: Introduce sound effects that enhance the storytelling experience based on narrative elements.
User Preferences Learning: Implement a learning mechanism that adapts the storytelling style based on user feedback and choices over time.
Example Workflow:
User Input:

Name: "Alice"
Preferred Genre: "Fantasy"
Initial Emotion: "Happy"
System Output:

A personalized fantasy story narrated in a happy tone with suitable background music and sound effects.
Detailed Project Breakdown:
1. Dynamic Story Generation
Use OpenAI's text generation capabilities to create stories based on user inputs, including preferences for characters, settings, and themes.
2. Emotion Recognition
Implement an emotion recognition mechanism that analyzes user voice input to gauge emotional states and adjust narration style.
3. Adaptive Audio Experience
Generate background music and sound effects dynamically to match the story's emotional tone, enhancing immersion.
4. Real-Time Interaction
Allow users to verbally influence the story progression, integrating their feedback to make the experience interactive.
5. Memory Integration
Track user preferences and past interactions to improve future storytelling sessions and personalize content.
