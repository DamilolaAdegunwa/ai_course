Project Title: Real-time Multilingual Conference Call Transcription with Speaker Identification, Translation, and Sentiment Analysis
File Name: realtime_conference_transcription_translation_sentiment.py

Project Description:
In this project, we will develop a real-time conference call transcription system that can:

Transcribe audio from multiple participants in real time.
Identify speakers dynamically, labeling each segment of the transcription with the correct speaker.
Translate the transcription into multiple languages.
Perform sentiment analysis on each speaker's contributions, determining whether their tone is positive, neutral, or negative.
Summarize the conversation per speaker, breaking down their key points and sentiment over time.
This project combines real-time processing, speaker diarization, multilingual translation, and sentiment analysis, making it a significantly more complex task than the previous projects.

Project Breakdown:
Real-time Audio Capture:

This step simulates capturing audio from a conference call, though in a real-world application, you would integrate with an API or library that can capture live audio streams.
Transcription with Speaker Diarization:

Using Vosk (an open-source speech recognition toolkit) to identify different speakers and assign labels to their speech.
Multilingual Translation:

Transcribing the conversation in English and then translating it into the target language (French in this example) using a Hugging Face translation model.
Sentiment Analysis:

Each speaker's statements are analyzed for sentiment (positive, neutral, negative) using Hugging Face's sentiment analysis pipeline.
Speaker-wise Summarization:

Summarize the transcription per speaker and attach the sentiment analysis results to provide insights into each speaker's tone and contribution during the conversation.
Final Report:

The system generates a report containing:
The original transcription of the call.
The translated version of the call in the chosen language.
A detailed speaker-wise summary with sentiment analysis.
Example Inputs and Outputs:
Example 1:

Input Audio: A conference call with three participants discussing business strategy in English.

Expected Output:

Original Transcription: The full conversation transcribed with speaker labels.
Translation: The entire conversation translated into French.
Sentiment Analysis:
Speaker 1: Mostly positive tone throughout the conversation.
Speaker 2: Neutral to negative, especially when discussing the risks involved in the strategy.
Speaker 3: Neutral tone with occasional positive comments.
Final Report: Saved as conference_call_report.txt, including transcription, translation, and speaker summaries.
Key Features:
Real-time Transcription: Capable of handling live conference calls with multiple speakers.
Speaker Diarization: Automatically separates the contributions of different participants and labels their speech.
Multilingual Translation: Allows the transcription to be translated into other languages for non-native participants.
Sentiment Analysis: Provides insights into each speaker's attitude and tone.
Summarized Report: Summarizes the contributions of each speaker, making it easy to review the conversation after the call.
Use Cases:
Multinational Business Meetings: Businesses with participants from different countries can automatically transcribe and translate conversations, ensuring all attendees understand.
Customer Support Calls: Analyze the sentiment of customer support conversations to assess customer satisfaction and agent performance.
Legal Transcriptions: Create transcriptions with speaker attribution and sentiment tracking for court proceedings or legal discussions.
Podcast Transcriptions: For multilingual podcasts, transcribe and translate the conversations into different languages while analyzing the sentiment of each guest.
This project takes audio transcription, speaker diarization, translation, and sentiment analysis a step further by combining them into a real-time conference call processing system. Itâ€™s noticeably more complex than previous projects as it integrates several advanced techniques to provide a comprehensive and multilingual report on the conversation.
